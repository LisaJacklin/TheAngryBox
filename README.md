### EE 444: Embedded Systems

##### Team Members: 
- Audrey Eikenberry
- Jessica Pennock
- Lisa Jacklin

#### Background
Using the MSP430F5438A boards including several different sensors that we have chosen from to create, the angry box. Using CrossStudio for MSP430, we will be programming and incorporating the additional peripherals including, the LCD screen on the MSP430, accelorator, photocell, potentially audio capabilities, as well as the gyroscope for angle motion. Using all of these items, we will create an embedded system that will respond to the user in terms of the LCD screen and potentially even audio when ever motion occurs.

#### Potential Utilzations of the Angry Box
This embedded system could come in handle with applicances that must remain in a single place for a task, consider a laser leveler or perhaps an item that must only be stored right side up. This system could warn the user of motion and tell them to restore the original location or orientation to allow the main device to continue performing its assigned task.


### Tasks and Expectations
- [] Setting up the Accelerometer 
- [] Transmit and recieve data from the accelerometer and the board
- [] Read and record data before moving on to the next ISR or task
- [] Setting up the LCD screen to display strings
- [] adjust the LCD screen based on the ISR reached and the response that was given via the Accel. and User
- [] Set the button to display a message to the LCD screen based on button press.


##### Weekly Breakdown and Progress
